# Basic Problem Solving in JavaScript

This repository marks the beginning of my journey in learning to program. The following questions serve as a foundation for understanding basic programming concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

## Problem Statements

1. **mindGame()**: A function that takes a positive number as input, multiplies it by 3, adds 10, divides by 2, and deducts 5 to show the result.

2. **evenOdd()**: A function that takes a string as input and determines if the number of characters is even or odd.

3. **isLGSeven()**: A function that takes a number as input, finds the difference between the input value and 7, and returns either the difference or double the input value based on certain conditions.

4. **findingBadData()**: A function that takes an array containing positive and negative numbers, identifies "Bad Data" (negative numbers), and returns the quantity of such data.

5. **gemsToDiamond()**: A function that takes 3 numeric values representing the number of gems each of 3 friends have, calculates the total quantity of diamonds they can get by converting their gems, and adjusts the total if necessary.
